# Program to find area of circle using graph

* The area is found by converting the circle into many rectangles by plotting its radius as x-axis and circumference as y-axis.
* The area under the graph will be the area of the circle. 
* The area of the circle is then found by taking the sum of all the rectangles.

### Normally area of circle is found by taking area of the whole triangle 
* A = ½ × base ×height
* A = ½ × (2πr) × r
* A = πr2
